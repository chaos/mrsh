.Sh NAME
.Nm mrsh
.Nd munge authenticated remote shell
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mrsh
.Op Fl dn
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Ar host
.Op command
.Nm mrsh
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mrsh
is a modification of the 
.Nm rsh
command that uses munge authentication instead of reserved
ports for security.  Just like
.Nm rsh,
.Nm mrsh
executes
.Ar command
on
.Ar host  .
.Pp
.Nm Mrsh
copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard
output of the remote command to its standard output, and the
standard error of the remote command to its standard error.
Interrupt, quit and terminate signals are propagated to the remote
command;
.Nm mrsh
normally terminates when the remote command does.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option turns on socket debugging (using
.Xr setsockopt  2  )
on the
.Tn TCP
sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl l
By default, the remote username is the same as the local username.
The
.Fl l
option allows the remote name to be specified.
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n
option redirects input from the special device
.Pa /dev/null
(see the
.Sx BUGS
section of this manual page).
.It Fl M
The
.Fl M
option allows an alternate munge unix domain path to be specified.
.It Fl P
The
.Fl P
option allows an alternate service port to be specified.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V
option outputs the package and protocol version.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar command
is specified, you will be logged in on the remote host using
.Xr mrlogin  1  .
.Pp
Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on local machine,
while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote machine.
For example, the command
.Pp
.Dl mrsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile
.Pp
appends the remote file
.Ar remotefile
to the local file
.Ar localfile ,
while
.Pp
.Dl mrsh otherhost cat remotefile \&">>\&" other_remotefile
.Pp
appends
.Ar remotefile
to
.Ar other_remotefile .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mrlogin 1
.Sh BUGS
If you are using
.Xr csh  1
and put a
.Nm mrsh
in the background without redirecting its input away from the terminal,
it will block even if no reads are posted by the remote command.
If no input is desired you should redirect the input of
.Nm mrsh
to
.Pa /dev/null
using the
.Fl n
option.
.Pp
You cannot run an interactive command
(like
.Xr rogue  6
or
.Xr vi  1  )
using
.Nm mrsh  ;
use
.Xr mrlogin  1
instead.
.Pp
Stop signals stop the local
.Nm mrsh
process only; this is arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons
too complicated to explain here.
