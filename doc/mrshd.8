.Sh NAME
.Nm mrshd
.Nd munge authenticated remote shell server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mrshd
.Op Fl ahlnL
.Nm mrshd
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mrshd
server
is the server for the 
.Xr mrsh 1
program.  It is a modification of the
.Nm rshd
server and uses munge authentication rather than reserved 
ports for security.
.Pp
The
.Nm mrshd
server
listens for service requests at the port indicated in
the ``mshell'' service specification; see
.Xr services 5 .
.Pp
Transport-level keepalive messages are enabled unless the
.Fl n
option is present.
The use of keepalive messages allows sessions to be timed out
if the client crashes or becomes unreachable.
.Pp
The 
.Fl L
option causes all successful accesses to be logged to
.Xr syslogd 8
as
.Li auth.info
messages and all failed accesses to be logged as
.Li auth.notice .
.Pp
.It Fl M
The
.Fl M
option allows an alternate munge unix domain path to be specified.
.Pp
The
.Fl V
option outputs the package and protocol version.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
All errors are logged via the syslog (3) library.  Administrators
should check the log files for details regarding errors.  Error
messages send to the user are intentionally ambiguous, so that
details about state information cannot be interpreted.
