.Os "Linux Mrsh"
.Sh NAME
.Nm mrlogin
.Nd munge authenticated remote login
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mrlogin
.Op Fl 8ELd
.Op Fl e Ar char
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Ar host
.Nm mrlogin
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mrlogin
is a modification of the
.Nm rlogin
command that uses munge authentication instead of reserved
ports for security.  Just like
.Nm rlogin,
.Nm mrlogin
starts a terminal session on a remote host
.Ar host  .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl 8
The
.Fl 8
option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise
parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
characters are other than
^S/^Q .
.It Fl E
The
.Fl E
option stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
When used with the
.Fl 8
option, this provides a completely transparent connection.
.It Fl L
The
.Fl L
option allows the mrlogin session to be run in ``litout'' (see
.Xr tty 4 )
mode.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option turns on socket debugging (see
.Xr setsockopt 2 )
on the TCP sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.It Fl e
The
.Fl e
option allows user specification of the escape character, which is
``~'' by default.
This specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal
value in the form \ennn.
.It Fl M
The
.Fl M
option allows an alternate munge unix domain path to be specified.
.It Fl P
The
.Fl P
option allows an alternate service port to be specified.
.It Fl V
The 
.Fl V
option outputs the package and protocol version.
.El
.Pp
A line of the form ``<escape char>.'' disconnects from the remote host.
Similarly, the line ``<escape char>^Z'' will suspend the
.Nm mrlogin
session, and ``<escape char><delayed-suspend char>'' suspends the
send portion of the mrlogin, but allows output from the remote system.
By default, the tilde (``~'') character is the escape character, and
normally control-Y (``^Y'') is the delayed-suspend character.
.Pp
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
the
.Nm mrlogin
is transparent.
Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts
are handled properly.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is utilized by
.Nm mrlogin :
.Bl -tag -width TERM
.It Ev TERM
Determines the user's terminal type.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mrsh 1
.Sh BUGS
More of the environment should be propagated.
